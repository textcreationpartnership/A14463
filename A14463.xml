            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>It is a coniunction which is made by aliance, by the whiche the man and the woman that are vnited &amp; ioyned togither by the ſame, haue a ſpeciall communion betwene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the which the huſbande hath not with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther women, nor the woman with other men.</p>

                     <p>It is eaſie to ſée.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God. For ſéeing that God can not be knowen nor comprehended in his diuine eſſence, nor in his maieſtie, if we will haue ſuch knowledge as is neceſſarie to our ſaluation, it is requiſite that we goe and ſéeke him, &amp; behold him there where it hath pleaſed him to declare and reueale him ſelfe vnto vs, and that by thoſe meanes which he hath giuen vs. For if we do otherwyſe, we do then forge him to be ſuche a one as the vanitie of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding may imagine him and from thence it ſhall come to paſſe, that in the ſteade of him we ſhall make vnto oure ſelues ſtraunge gods, which ſhall be no gods, but thinking to ſerue God, we ſhall ſerue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuell. Wherfore it is not inough that we beléeue that there are gods, but that there is one only god. And yet for al that this is not inough ſo to do, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> alſo we do beleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this god, which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true god, is maker of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; of earth,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:19826:224"/> and of all creatures viſible and inuiſible: which thing all thoſe that do beléeue that there are Goddes, do not beléeue at all. Moreouer, for ſo muche as man is fallen through ſinne, and that he hath néede to be reſtored, it behoueth vs to know alſo how that ſame God which hath created vs, is alſo the very ſame God that hath reſtored &amp; ſaued vs, and by what meane he hath done the ſame, to the ende that we ſhoulde acknowledge him to be our onely maker and leader, father, ſauiour, and redéemer, and none elſe: and that we ſhould acknowledge in him the benefite of our creation, which ſignifieth alſo his prouidence, and our reſtoring and rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>I will ſo do. We may not doubt but that God is neceſſarily good, iuſte, wiſe, holy, almightie and perfecte, for he can be none other, nor do any thing but that which is godly, iuſtly, wiſely and

<pb n="516" facs="tcp:19826:265"/> beholde this interpretation is very plaine, whiche declareth vnto vs that it is a great vertue, and worthie of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, to contemne father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in time and place, which is to ſay, in ſuch like caſes as wée haue already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of: for ſuch a contempt of them, is not a contempt, to ſpeake properly, but onely in the iudgement of man, no more than the hatered whiche Ieſus Chriſte willeth vs to beare them for his ſake, is a hatered, but a very true loue, founded in the loue of GOD. For wée muſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iudge of thinges according to their effectes, than according to the affections of men, in whom we doe conſider them, as in diuers other like paſſages of the Scripture: It is written in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbes, in the which Salomon ſpeaketh in the perſon of wiſedome:<note place="margin">Prouerb. 8.</note> All thoſe that hate me, loue death.
